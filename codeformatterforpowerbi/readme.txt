Use this plugin to format your Power BI Codes (DAX and M) via simple shorttags

== Description ==

WordPress plugin for formatting and beautifying of DAX and M code
(as used in PowerQuery, PowerBI and Excel PowerPivot)

= M code (PowerQuery) =
``[mcode theme=dark linewidth=90 width=600px ]let a = 1 in a[/mcode]

= DAX code (PowerBI, PowerPivot) =
``[daxcode width=600px region=US]EVALUATE myTable[/daxcode]

All shortcode attributes are optional.

The formatted results for unchanged code are cached (for 30 days) via WordPress transients.
